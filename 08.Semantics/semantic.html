<!-- 
  SEMANTIC HTML EXAMPLE
  ---------------------
  What are semantics used for?
  • Semantic tags tell the browser and people what each part of the page means.
  • They make the code easier to read and understand.
  • They help search engines and screen readers understand your page better.
  • Examples of semantic tags: <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>.

  In this example we are using all these tags with comments explaining their purpose.
